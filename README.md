# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
---
## Overview of Project
 The purpose of this project is to help our client, Louise, to find the correlation between specific Kickstarter campaigns, campaign launch dates and campaign fundraising goals to see their rates of success, failure or cancellation.

### Analysis and Challenges
Starting this analysis required looking at 2 outcomes within our Kickstarter data. The two things we needed to look at were, the outcomes by launch date and the outcomes based on goals. The outcome we are referring to is the type of campaign, which in the dataset is the clumn titled *Parent Category*. The launch date refers to the date the campaign was created. We converting the launch date in the dataset using the date conversion code, `(((J2/60)/60)/24)+DATE(1970,1,1)` to convert the Unix timestamp into **MM/DD/YYYY** format. The column that was used to do this conversion is titled *launched_at* and made a new column titled *Date Created Conversion*. The goals being referred to for this analysis is the amount of fundraising money each campaign needed. The column used is titled *goal*. The last thing to do was to create one last column with just the Year by using `YEAR()`.

In order to do this analysis we created 2 new sheets within our Excel file. Each sheet was titled properly based on the data being collected. The first one made was **Theater Outcomes By Launch Date**. Within this analysis, we only focused on theater campaigns and how many were successful, failed or got canceled. To do this analysis we made a pivot table of the entire Kickstarter dataset. We filtered it by *Parent Category* and *Year*. The column showed the *outcomes* of the campaigns. The Values were the *count of the outcomes*. Fianlly the Rows showed the *Date Created Conversion*. The pivot table was then filtered by *Parent Category* to just show theater campaigns. Once we got the data we wanted we created a line chart to show the # of theater campaigns that were successful, failed, or canceled per month.

The second sheet created for this analysis is titled **Outcomes Based on Goals**. Within this analysis we created a chart based on ranges of goals and then used the `COUNTIFS()` and `SUM()` function to see the amount of successful, failed or canceled plays were in each goal range. With each goal range we totaled the projects and then divided each amount by the total to get the percentage for each outcome. For example, our first range is *Less than 1000*, in order to get the amount of successful, failed and canceled outcomes we used the `COUNTIFS` function for each outcome using the Kickstarter dataset. After that was done we used the `SUM()` function to add all the outcomes togehter within that range described earlier. After that we divided the amount of the successful, failed or canceled outcomes within that goal range separately by the total projects. That was repeated through 12 different goal ranges made, the last one being *Greater than 50000*. Once all the data was collected we made a line chart to visualize the comparison of each outcomes percentage, in its goal range.

While doing this analysis there weren't many direct challenges that came along. However, there could have been many. Some that could have affected our datasets we made would be if the functions we used were written incorrectly and we did not get the same numbers. Filtering the data is also very important. For example, if we had filtered the original Kickstarter dataset before making our pivot tables, our data would not be as exact.

#### Results
In conclusion, let's discuss what we observations we drew within the 2 data sheets, the limitations of the dataset and what other possible graphs could have been useful.
The first observation we can draw with the data sheet **Theater Outcomes By Launch Date** is that there is a spike in successful theater campaigns in the middle of the year between the months May-July. A second observation can be made that throughtout the year, the amount of canceled theater campaigns stay in a pretty consistent range between 0-4 with an outlier of January being 7. The second data sheet, **Outcomes Based on Goals** is that the percentage of successful and failed seem to entertwine with each other throughout the goal ranges, while the percentage of canceled is always at 0. Some of the limitations that are within this dataset is that the latest the campaigns were researched was 2017, so trends could be different with more up to date campaigns. Also, the *Parent Category* seems small compared to the *Subcategory* options. To finish, we believe the pivot table and line chart are the best options to visualize this dataset, but a pivot chart, bar graph and pie chart might also show the data in a different way as well.
